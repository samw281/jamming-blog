  ## Description 
    Jamming Blog is meant to be a place where you can discuss your favorite music and musicians amongst friends from the greater music community. Logging in is required, to keep the information secure and add an element of privacy but once youâ€™re in you can see all of the posts and comments on those posts as well as write new posts and comments. As a user I want to be able to communicate with the world around me about the music that I love. I want to be able to make posts about that music in order to cultivate a deeper love for as well as enjoyment and appreciation of the music and musicians of my choice. I also want the greater community to be able to comment on my posts and edit their comments for typos or clarity.
